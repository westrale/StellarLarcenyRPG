# This script will automatically heal a character when they Level Up.
#     You can set the healing to be equal to the amount of Max HP (MP)
#     gained by the Level Up, or you can heal them completely.

# This script is compatible with nearly all other scripts, including the
#     "Level-Up Healing" script that is also included in this pack.
#     If you are using any other scripts that alias level_up, be
#     judicious about where you place them, as this script needs
#     to do operations both before and after the normal "level_up" method.

# As part of the Community DLC Pack, you may use this script royalty-free
#     for commercial or noncommercial use in any RPG Maker project.

# More of my work can be found at wavescripts.wordpress.com.

# This script should be placed in the "Materials" section
#     of the script editor.  In general, this script should
#     be placed below other scripts that modify the level_up
#     method, but you may need to play around with the order.
