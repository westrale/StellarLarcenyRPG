------- PLOT -------------
--------------------------
-Tutorial: Starts with PC waking up groggily to rogues, with guns and strange symbols, that 
   panic when they see you coming to. PC freaks out and grabs their hidden slug pistol and 
   starts blasting his way out, shooting of cuttthroats with tutorial presented as his own 
   thoughts. Cutthroats use hand signals and strange gutterspeak, with the player finding a 
   few datavids that introduce the setting. A realization dawns on the player that the 
   cutthroats are really just ragged militia members and they yell at you to stop. As you 
   get arrested, an alien ambushes the caravan with cascading plasma explosions. 
-Act 1 Boss Mercenary Lord - Player hides and does jobs to save up for a shuttle offworld.
  End of Privateer/Mercenary Arc, Merc Lord wants the cloaking technology stolen during a job
  he contracted you for. Had friends in Pirates, dies with tracer activated.
-Act 2 Boss Pirate Lord - Massive Power struggle infighting war triggered by PC manipulating
  Pirate Captains and taking their revenues away through trading. Culminates in a race to 
  defuse the Pirate's Supernova Bomb.

  Nex. Boss is the Nex's AI....kills first party (except main pc) sent to defeat him by 
  detonating Nex PC, party wonders exactly how long the charge was active. Boss defies their
  question, refuses to answer. "That secret will just have to die with you..."
  Inactives have to replace others. Shared xp shouldnt be a problem, auto-assign gear if 
  neglected?

    PULSE WEAPONS -- Technology that resembles explosive weapons, but uses waves of undercurrent
      concussive force blasts to break down matter just before exploding, with each wave passing 
      through the target amplifying the explosion.
    DITCHDIGGER -- A common implement during the Zombie Apocalypse, this weapon is a simple
      splicing of a shovel with a heavy double-bladed axe on the other end, weighted against 
      the shovel end. A versatile and basic tool, it lasted through the Steampunk Eras and 
      beyond, especially on more primal worlds.
    QUANTUM MISSILES AND EXPLOSIVES: Missiles that are extremely hard to shoot down and change
      quantum states while in transit, hence the name. Are able to pack 2x the explosive 
      charge.

      heating in the target, burning their skin , water absorbs heat thru dialetic heating, non-lethal
    DISRUPTOR: A much more powerful laser weapon, a disruptor is a highly dangerous, albeit 
      shorter range weapon, with unpredictable accuracy and varying levels of drain on each 
      shot. Its unpredictability make it less popular, but still effective in the right 
      situation.
    CRYOBLASTER: A useful weapon for those dealing with sensitive "cargo", the Cryoblaster 
      can freeze a target temporarily, the more the beam is fired on the target, the longer
      the freeze will last. It is tricky to permanently freeze a target, as the risk of 
      permanent breakage increases with every second shot at the target.
    TRACTOR BEAM: A ship or hand-held device that will form a gravity well around the target,
      keeping it from moving.
    SHOCKWAVE RIFLE: A large weapon that is used to fire massive shockwaves at a target,

      chill, while simultaneously generating electrical pulses in the user to heighten their
      adrenaline.
    STASIS FIELDS: A stasis field is an advanced coma inciting technology which drains its
      considerable power in one shot, but many cybernetics can nullify this, and the target
      will awaken if they suffer too much pain.
    MINIBOTS: Miniature robots that use weapons considerable for their size, and use their
      small stature to their advantage to sneak behind enemies, and attack in packs.
    CHAIN LASER MINIGUN: A highly valued weapon, this bulky weapon can overheat in a few 
      seconds, and is usually worth it to destroy your enemies in a hail of searing lasers.
    SHORT DOUBLE-BARRELLED BUCKSHOT PISTOL: Deceptively powerful for its size, this weapon
      is easily the most sought-after solid shot weapon on lesser advanced worlds, allowing
      the full power of the shotgun to be used in an even shorter range.
    ANTI-PHASE RIFLE: A highly advanced weapon, this is favored by the rich and paranoid. It
      allows the user to shoot and deny phasing opponents their ethereal skills.
    TRIPLE/QUAD BARREL RIFLE: This weapon can shoot four shots in very rapid succession or in
      tandem, providing excellent long-range cover fire. Decreases accuracy on each shot.
    BLINK GUN: A very chaotic weapon, this gun will teleport anybody it is fired at a random 
      distance and direction away from the caster. Proximity affects the variation heavily.
    MAGNETIC GUN: A weapon that fires magnetic force mixed with a concussive explosion that
      knocks enemies back and keeps heavier targets pinned down entirely.
    MICROFILAMENT BLADE: Any bladed weapon with ceramic polymers mixed in with hard 
      gemstones with the metal to allow for an expensive combat solution, but one worth its 
      weight.

      the attention of missile defense systems. 2 decoys and 3 missiles fired per salvo.
      Takes a very long time to reload.
    LASHERS: Difficult to weild, these whips have a small power core which conducts 
      electricity along the metallic whips and allows for ranged electrocution with more 
      accuracy and safety than most weapons.
    BOW: A simple, beautiful bow. Good for silent kills against unarmored targets.
    CROSSBOW: A simple, square crossbow. Good for spontaneous silent kills against lightly
      armored targets.
    MECHANIZED BOW: A bow that makes loading arrows extremely light and effortless.

----------------------------
-------- CULTURAL ----------
----------------------------
  SPEECH: -- COMMON -- American English mixed with some Spanish and minimal German influences but far 
  advanced, 2000 years of cultural development. Minimal German influence explained by German 
  Engineers prospering in the early years of colonization. Around 2100, full integration of 
  Latino cultures had begun in earnest due to its already sizable integration. No one culture is 
  dominant due to the millenia of integration.
  -- HIGH -- The asiatic cultures of the 22nd century did not integrate due to major
  differences in social issues which was a major issue at the time. Since then, its culture
  has been preserved in the form of historical artifacts still revered to this day. Japanese as
  a language is used mainly used for covert operations and a select few high administration 
  offices because they wanted to not speak the common tongue and be overheard. A language of
  the secretive and the paranoid.
  -- LOW -- A language used commonly but not by the decent people, used as a mixture of harsh
  slang and many hand signals, it allows them to be quick and silent when conversing without
  even the spoken part being heard. Often uses coded sequences in slang terms so that even
  former Low speakers do not understand new slang.

  RACES --
    --HUMANS: Same as present day with huge advancements in technology. Focus on 
      paranoia/greed.
    --THE THRATHIL: Nicknamed "Thraths". Inspired by Wing Commander's Kilrathi a warlike 
      cat-based evolved race of warriors. Disgusted by capitalism, privateering and piracy.
    --THE LANTESS: Nicknamed "Lants". A race of insectoid Communal entities forgoing the use 
      of language and civilization, they refuse all economy and trade and only want what is good 
      for their race. Modeled after praying mantises with spider pets. Highly telepathic.
    --THE MISTRECI: Nicknamed "Mists". A race of red-skinned muscular humanoids with 
      extreme sadistic tendencies, use horns and claws in combat, adorn them with beautiful 
      jewelry. Direct and violent, however, they will never be seen as greedy.
    --THE KRELLATH: Nicknamed "Krells". A race of green half-serpentine shapeshifters that 
      pursue all economical interests with reckless abandon. Very avarice-focused motives that 
      can shed their skin to become humanoid or to half-mimic other races' appearances.
    --THE NEX: Nicknamed "Nexes". A robotic race that have a sort of techno-worshipping 
      culture, eshew morals and economics and instead revere the AI Terrorists as gods. Are
      developing a galaxy-wide weapon of last resort using wormholes to destroy stars and 
      create quasars. They appear to be suits of medieval armor with heavy death thematic
      elements.
    --THE UTH: An anaerobe-based barbarian race, they look like rocky giants, evolved from 
      bacteria that can survive any form of radiation, even nuclear, and survive without oxygen. 
      They eat one another for sustenance but do not abhor more tender meats. Their only 
      function is to destroy and consume, even if it is only against themselves that 
      they succeed. They spread bacteria upon the end of a successful battle, or upon death, often 
      times both. Bacteria can be toxic to humans and will result in humanoid infections that act 
      out of control. They are virtually impossible to eradicate, due to their immunity to any and 
      all radiation. Thankfully they understand little about creating technology. They do, however, 
      have the ability to understand how metals work, thanks to metallugical engineering being a 
      part of their DNA, and the ability to adapt that to weapons and armor that tear through any 
      unshielded target is terrifying. It is common to encourage people to detonate a grenade if 
      they are in a situation where they think they will die in combat against them, since they
      resist radiation but fire does the trick. 
    --THE OLD ONES: The typical grey alien stereotype often referred to by alien abduction in the late
      20th century. They abducted humankind over two centuries, creating the Althren and the 
      Nortu. Mysteriously vanished from the Universe some thousand years ago. The Time Agency is very 
      interested. The KRELLATH are involved. <PLOT STORY ARC>.
    --THE ALTHREN: Alternate path of evolution of humankind, advanced and bioengineered to have greater
      intellect and engineering prowess, have the most advanced Psymancers Cybernetics and are 
      very conniving. Can interbreed with other Human sub-types but it does not often happen. 
      Resemble humans with elongated heads (but not cranium), ears, fingers, pale bluish skin. 
    --THE NORTU: Alternate path of evolution of humankind, much larger and tribal, often work as 
      the best mercenaries and smiths, although they cannot concieve of more complex 
      technologies. Steampunk-esque. Are very much against cybernetics and consider them as 
      stealing the soul. Technology doesn't make sense but allies with Uth make it work.

  GOVERNMENTS: 
    COMMERCE UNIONS (Act 1/2/4)
    MERCENARY GUILDS (Act 1)
    PIRATE CLANS (Act 2)
    THE CONSORTIUM (Act 3/4)

    TIME AGENCY (All Acts)
    LOCAL AUTHORITIES (Act 1)
    ANTI-PIRACY (Act 2)
    CUSTOMS AGENTS (Act 2)
    
  ECONOMIES -- Many and varied, humankind has long discovered the value in maintaining 
  independence from government, especially the <name for rebellious and low-class peoples?>. They
  have also discovered the value in trade, even if only to learn more about threats.
  -They range from a <BARTER> system on the most paranoid/distant worlds that dont want anything
  controlling the value of goods aside from the goods themselves. 
  -Then there is the <CURRENCY> economy based on a precious compact metal that varies from world 
  to world. 
  -<SERVICE> A more complex form of the currency economy. This is a type of economy 
  where the market is more focused on people providing services for other people, and the sale of 
  products is somewheat less significant although necessary. 
  -<DIGITAL RIGHTS> An even more complex version of the CURRENCY economy, where money 
  is derived from the value of owned ideas and influence, where only the copyright and idea owners 
  can use them in any form. 
  -<INTEGRATED> economy which manages currency through electronic means mixed 
  with experimental DNA technologies to prevent easy theft. It is a great deal more complex and 
  built to control technology as much as business. All currency is valued according to the 
  <CONSORTIUM>, a multi-world covert assignment of values of everything across the Empire. 
  The <CONSORTIUM MASTERS> control the flow of all valuation, and monitor the <COMMON STOCK MARKET> 
  very closely and shut down stocks that offend the flow of valuation they have in mind. 
  At times, stock termination will result in destruction of countless innocents and homes, but their 
  deaths impact the CONSORTIUM little. This results, more often in not, than rebels and human terrorists.
  
  MILITARY - The concept of an army/brigade unit was deemed archaic, since battles can be won
  by a single individual with the right technology at the right time, and puts the majority of
  grunts and citizens at risk. Also, the value of covert/guerilla tactics only increased over
  the 2,000 years of advanced human evolution. Now, The military is more a shadow organization
  than an institution. Invasions, however, must be countered by a large number of military 
  agents only available in times of crisis. A plot point would be an invasion provoked to 
  achieve a military response that they would abuse.
    PRAETORIANS GUARD: A term used throughout Human history to describe the most powerful 
    elite honor guard, which applies to these super-soldiers. Some call them Genetic freaks, 
    others fascists puppets, and others saviors. They have an array of additional organs and 
    have the best cybernetic implants available, and operate according to a "Tactical Bible",
    which each of them have memorized for any given situation. There are multiple variations
    of their genetics which make them unpredictable with differing traits.
    INVESTIGATIVE AGENT: A freeform term used for covert operatives that operate within an all-inclusive
    mandate, and have no legal boundaries. They are given the best equipment and sent in to
    unknown dangers. Sometimes they will requisition any citizen/soldier they can get their 
    hands on, sometimes through sheer intimidation and death threats. Praetorians often refuse.
        
  VIDEO GAMES -- Games have evolved over the course of human history, from simple dice games
  to video games to VR programs to Simulators (banned due to miliary technology being 
  accessible to anyone) to Cybernetic Possession, the ability to posess someone with any 
  electronic device. Heavily chastised by the Miliary. Certain AI use this to terrifying 
  effect. AI's are banned and existing AI's are nearly immortal and are prime threats to 
  Electronic Security. Main villain should be an AI with control of stock market that uses
  Reporter Conglomerates and Corrupt Praetorians, along with NEX and easily coerced human
  terrorists.

  DRUGS -- One drug called <FLUX> puts the victim in a time-slowing state abusing the brain's 
  ability to change the perception of time and light sensitivity. Sometimes FLUX is used to 
  aid in the hacking ability with severe migraine and muscle pains. <COZONE> is a drug that
  colors the hair and external dermal cells red (Conan reference) and places victims in a 
  catatonic state but leaves their pleasure receptors functioning at incredibly high levels
  and in a dream state where external stimuli are represented as good dream elements. This is
  a massively insidious threat gaining popularity on the worlds where poverty is rampant and
  people despair about the loss of control in their lives. <ZOOM> is a drug about amplifying
  the natural brain processes and musculature growth and is an extremely potent performance-
  enhancing drug originally developed for the prototype PRAETORIAN GUARD.
  
  NEWS REPORTERS/CONGLOMERATES: Some reporters are so influential they control as much
  of the Common Stock Market as anyone. With news brings attention, with attention 
  comes editorializing, and with editorializing comes half-truths towards whatever they get
  paid to say, and have a sway over the common people. This lets them become rich and 
  influential individuals with entire units of mercenaries to do their bidding. Multiple News
  Reporters that achieve a certain level of status can group together and form a Conglomerate
  which can influence entire systems of planets.

  TIME TRAVEL AGENTS -- Agents that center around monitoring wormholes and investigating
  time lapse anomalies and technologies that are out of place for their place and time. 
  (FARSCAPE/STARGATE UNIVERSE/DR. WHO REFERENCES?) External NPC's that always pop up at the
  right/wrong time and are in conflict with Reporter Conglomerates and Praetorians.
